🏦 Banking Program (Python)

🔹 Overview

The Banking Program is a console-based Python application that simulates the core operations of a simple banking system. It allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and manage banking transactions through an interactive command-line interface.

This project demonstrates a strong grasp of Python programming fundamentals, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, functions, loops, conditional logic, and exception handling — all structured around a clean and logical program flow.
